# FlashDevelop-Flixel-Nape

The FlashDevelop-Flixel-NAPE repository is intended to assist Doug and Filip in collaboration on Flixel projects.  We are just now learning to use Flixel, but also are only just learning to use GitHub.   This README file was automatically created when the repository was created.  It contained only that first line that says, "# FlashDevelop-Flixel-Nape".   In the 'initial-commit' that file was committed to the repository.   
These comments, that start on line 3, and continue on line 4, were added in a Branch called 'Readme-edits'.   We should be able to understand the version management process by making changes to this file and seeing the difference between this file as it appears in the 'Master' versus the various branches we create.
